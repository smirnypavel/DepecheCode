My role was - scrum master and developer  

As a Scrum Master, I facilitated the effective implementation of the Scrum methodology, managed processes, conducted daily stand-ups, organized sprint planning, and removed obstacles to enable the development team to achieve their goals.

As a developer, I utilized technologies such as Sass (CSS preprocessor), HTML, JavaScript, and a build tool like Parcel to streamline the development process, improve code organization, enhance styling capabilities, and efficiently bundle and optimize the project assets for deployment.
